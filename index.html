        <div class="William_Barton">
          <h3>William C. Barton</h3>
          <h5>William C. Barton was an American soldier in WW2. He was part of a group that liberated a concentration in Bavaria, Germany. William was born in Davenport, 
          Iowa, and worked as a cook at Bishop’s Cafeteria. When he enlisted in the army, he was part of the 42nd Rainbow Infantry Company G and landed in Europe on December 
          9th, 1945. He quickly made his way up the ranks to become the staff sergeant. He was part of the Battle of Central Europe and the Battle of the Bulge. On April 29th, 
          1945, his group made it to the camp Dachau where he was one of the first liberators for three days. William describes the utter shock and an information void during 
          this time. He claims, “No one knew what was going on...not even General Collins.” He says this camp was indescribable and no photos, videos, movies, or documentaries 
          can describe what they saw in Dachau. He even says, “Peace is not to know the horrors of (this) war.” The first thing he saw upon entering were piles of dead bodies; 
          some were mounds of 1800 individuals. Of those 1800, some were alive, and 200 German Shepherd guard dogs were running wild within the camps. He describes the camps as 
          destruction and chaos of an indescribable magnitude. No one knew what to do; filth and disease were so rampant, they had to leave and call every military doctor or 
          nurse they had. William was later awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart award for his bravery in the liberation effort. Upon returning to Iowa, he became a chef 
          at the Times Cafeteria and was also an electrician. On October 29th, 1998, William C. Barton passed away.  </h5>

        <div class="Celina">
        <h3>Celina Karp Biniaz</h3>
        <h5>Celina’s story is of a young schoolgirl whose childhood was stolen from her but who built a happy and productive life when she moved to Des Moines, Iowa with her 
          parents at the age of 16. Her triumph came on May 9th, 1945, which marked the liberation of the last death camps, and Germany's surrender. Celina survived and 
          credited Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who spent his entire fortune saving families from the concentration camps. Mr. Schindler set up a factory near 
          Auschwitz to have Jewish prisoners work and enjoy fundamental freedoms. He did this by bribing Nazi officials to get Jews into his factories, where he arranged for a 
          more suitable environment for them during the war. The “Schindler’s List” is a writing of the 1100 individuals he saved. He especially believed in saving families to 
          ensure that future generations prosper, and luckily when Celina moved to Des Moines, she was with her family. </h5>
        <h5>Celina stayed in the Auschwitz death camp for six weeks before she was liberated and sent to the munition factory of Oskar Schindler. While at Auschwitz, she came 
          in contact with Dr. Joseph Mengele, a man responsible for the loss of approximately 1 million lives and was known as the Nazi “butcher” or the “angel of death.” 
          Celina is the only known person who convinced him to let her live. Eventually, the Russian army liberated Poland, where Auschwitz was located. Few children survived 
          Auschwitz, and because Celina worked with Mr. Schindler, she was one of the few kids that did. This day was May 9th, 1945, and she was granted freedoms under law, 
          not just under Mr. Schindler. Celina was 13 at this time and weighed less than 70 pounds. These survivors were under the protection of the Czech government and had 
          two priorities. The first was to find their families; organizations could help with this, such as the Red Cross and the Jewish Survivors organization. Through the 
          Red Cross, she was reunited with her family. The second task was to receive an education. Celina had not attended school in six years and had only completed first 
          grade. Luckily, Oskar Schindler supplied her with a tutor, and in the summer, she studied and was one of two Jewish kids to pass the exams to qualify for a Polish 
          high school. </h5>
        <h5>Unfortunately, later that year, in September, there was another insurrection of Jews in Eastern Poland. Borders were closed, but her parents smuggled themselves 
          out of Poland in a Russian truck. After a month of traveling through borders littered with bombs from proxy wars, she landed in a small town in Germany. At this 
          point, she was 14 years old and needed to learn German and English. Her family got rations of food from the United Nations; they sold some rations to nuns to tutor 
          her. At this time, nuns were the few Germans free of prejudice. She was tutored for two years; eventually, her parents found out that Oskar Schindler was in Munich; 
          quickly, they met with him, and he funded their trip to Des Moines. </h5>
        <h5>Now, she was 16 years old and had landed in Des Moines; finally, after nine years, she was with her entire extended family once again. She entered North High School 
          as a 12th grader - making a jump from 2nd to 12th. After North High School, she received a full scholarship to Grinnell college and graduated in 1952. From there, 
          she received a master's degree in teaching at Columbia University in New York City. There, she got married, had two kids, and taught at Milan High in New York City 
          for 27 years. </h5>
        <h5>During these 27 years in New York City, she came across Schindler's list. Few knew that the list was in NYC, and those who did, did not recognize its importance. 
          She informed others about the list, and eventually got it published for the world to see. Steven Spielberg directed a movie set in Poland about this list. After 
          filming this movie, Steven Spielberg made $50 million; with this money, he started the Shoah Foundation. Shoah in Hebrew means genocide. Through this foundation, 
          survivors of major events can share their stories with the world. Since then, he has collected 56,000 testimonies in 30 different languages. Celina's interview is 
          found here and she claims that "Schindler gave me life, but Spielberg gave me a voice." </h5> 
        <h5>This is Celina Karp Biniaz's remarkable story and how she survived. </h5>

        <div class="Blumenthal">
        <h3>Marion Blumenthal</h3>
        <h5>Marion Blumenthal Lazon is a survivor of the Holocaust. Her story begins on an average day in Germany in the 1930s; no one thought that the growing anti-Semitic 
          beliefs would lead to anything substantial. They lived in a small town, where her father was a shoemaker; their house was just above that store, where she lived with 
          her younger brother and grandparents. However, in 1935, Germany introduced the Nurenberg laws, imposing many restrictions on German Jews. Theaters, parks, and 
          swimming pools were deemed off-limits. Jews also had a curfew and were not allowed to shop in businesses owned by non-Jews or even live near non-Jews. "J" for Jews 
          was stamped on ID cards and passports. These are just a few of the many restrictions. In 1938, both her grandparents died, and her dad decided to immigrate to 
          America. Marion was four at this time. </h5>
        <h5>On November 9th, 1938, Nazis burned Jewish books and smashed the windows of Synagogues and Jewish-owned businesses; this is known as the "Night of Broken Glass" 
          and marks the escalation of anti-Semitism resulting in the Holocaust. On November 12th, the German government heavily fined Jewish individuals for the damage done. 
          Marion and her dad were now set to immigrate to the US in January of 1939. Instead of arriving, they were detained in Holland and were put in charge of 125 children 
          waiting to immigrate. They waited for 16 months. Finally, they were clear to immigrate; however, one day before their departure, Germany invaded Holland, borders 
          closed, and there was no escape. All their belongings were on the decimated ship set to depart. Marion and her dad were left with nothing and stayed in a cramped 
          Jewish ghetto. Every Monday night, lists were posted of whom Germany was sending to the concentration camps.</h5>
        <h5>Four years later, in May of 1944, Marion was sent to a concentration camp in Germany called Bergen Belsen. At this facility, German Shepherds were used as attack 
          dogs to intimidate the prisoners. Marion would be terrified of these animals for the rest of her life. Germany divided the camp into sections with electrified barbed 
          wire, guards, watchtowers, and spotlights positioned at every spot. Marion was placed in a section known as the "star camp" because they were still required to wear 
          their Jewish yellow star armbands, issued in Holland. In the "star camp", the German government hoped to exchange them for the Germans under house arrest by the 
          British in Palestine. No exchanges ever occurred. Most concentration camps contained heatless wooden barracks meant to contain 100 people, but they would force 600 
          people into each one. Campgrounds were filled with dead naked bodies. Role calls would occur every morning, with prisoners sometimes standing there without food or 
          water all day. Food was always scarce; the meal was a small bread ration with one cup of watery soup per day. Later, bread would only be distributed once a week. 
          Commonly, teenage boys would quickly die of starvation and sometimes, men would follow suit. Women and children were much more likely to survive the lack of food. 
          Showers were once a month, but this was also a tactic the Nazis used to exterminate Jews. Every month, paralyzed in fear, Marion was forced into the shower, unable 
          to know if Zyklon B gas or water would come. Marion claims that the filth, continuous horror, and fear of death are indescribable. No words, pictures, videos, or 
          documentaries will genuinely represent the magnitude and severity of what happened. </h5>
        <h5>Finally, the American and British armies were closing in from the West and the Russians from the East. Germany evacuated Bergen Belsen. Marion, her mother, and the 
          rest of the prisoners were put on trains and left in the dark, starving, dying of thirst, or dying of Typhus. Luckily, the Russian army arrived after two weeks in 
          April of 1945 and took these survivors to an evacuated village in Eastern Germany to eat what was left in the kitchens. Marion was ten years old and weighed 35 
          pounds; her mother was a mere 70 pounds. Fortunately, through the Red Cross organization, she and her mother were reunited with her brother and father. However, 
          after almost seven years of mental and physical torment in Europe, six weeks after it was over, her father died of Typhus. Marion, her mother, and her brother moved 
          to Israel. There, they both received their first formal education, starting at the preschool level. However, two years later, in 1948, British anti-semitism was 
          growing, and Britain restricted the number of Jews allowed to enter Israel. The three of them immigrated to the United States with tickets they had purchased ten 
          years earlier; they arrived on April 28th, 1948, exactly three years after the liberation of Bergen Belsen. Marion was now 13. She was supposed to be in 8th grade; 
          however, she was placed in 4th grade because of her poor education. From then, she worked night jobs to help pay bills, took as many classes as possible, attended 
          summer classes, and graduated eighth in her class of 267 from Central High School in Peoria, Illinois at the age of 18. </h5>
        <h5>This is Marion Blumenthal Lazon’s triumph over anti-Semitism across Europe. </h5>

        <h3>Michael Borenstein</h3>
        <h5>Michael Borenstein is a survivor of the Holocaust and the Auschwitz death camp. On January 27th, 1945, Auschwitz was liberated; Michael was five years old and the 
          youngest survivor of Auschwitz. His left forearm still shows the tattoo of his serial number, B1148. At the age of four, Mr. Borenstein was separated from his family 
          and became frail and starving to the point where he could not grow hair. Rats would bite his feet at night, and everyone he knew thought he was dead. Even today, 
          while riding in the New York subway he has flashbacks to the burning smell of flesh in the cattle cars he rode on his way to Auschwitz. Luckily, Michael is now 
          living freely in New York City and has earned an advanced degree - a PhD in communications.  </h5>
        <h5>Before WW2, Michael had a father, Israel Borenstein, an accountant, and his mother, Sophie Borenstein, a singer were part of a tight-knit Orthodox Jewish extended 
          family. However, on September 6th, 1939, the day known as "Bloody Monday" or the "Częstochowa massacre", the German army invaded Poland, bombed entire cities, and 
          took Jewish individuals captive. Sophie Borenstein even recalled watching a Nazi capture a family and force the men to dig a hole. The nazi soldier then killed them 
          and pushed them into the hole. Shortly after that, Jews were forced to wear an armband and were relocated into ghettos. Finally, on May 2nd, 1940, Michael Borenstein 
          was born into the Zarki ghetto. Thanks to Israel Borenstein, conditions were substantially better in that ghetto than other ghettos in Poland. The Zakari ghetto was 
          the longest-running ghetto in Poland before they were all ultimately sent to concentration camps. Israel Borenstein was in charge of the entire Zakari ghetto; he 
          raised money and bribed Nazi officials to let certain prisoners free, saving their lives. One prisoner he saved did not show up to work one day and was sentenced to 
          death. He also bribed Germans for travel visas and immigration paperwork, allowing Jews to escape to safer countries. Unfortunately, as anti-Semitic rhetoric became 
          more prevalent than before, the ghetto had to be exterminated and all inhabitants were eventually sent to various concentration camps. </h5>
        <h5>Nazis separated the Borenstein family in Auschwitz after they arrived in cattle cars. Conditions were grave and Michael Borenstein's grandfather suffocated during 
          the trip. When Michael arrived, he was four years old and lived in the children's bunk. His dad and older brother Samuel both died in the gas chambers; however, his 
          mom survived and would routinely smuggle food to keep him alive. When she died, Michael Borenstein was now almost five and had one relative left in Auschwitz, his 
          grandmother. To stay alive he would hide under her straw bed until they were both liberated on January 27th, 1945. </h5>
        <h5>This is Michael Borenstein’s story of overcoming Nazi Germany.</h5>

        <h3>Dean Lettington</h3>
        <h5>Dean Lettington is the youngest of nine children and as a teen in rural Iowa, he worked at a packing plant. Dean was one of the first liberators of the Jewish 
          concentration camp Dachau, and after 40 years of traumatic memories, he did not want to forget what he experienced. Instead, he gave interviews, speeches and openly 
          talked about his experience in WW2. When he entered the camp, he was the first in many of the buildings. He talks of the first housing barrack being dirtier than the 
          American barns that keep pigs and cows. The second barrack contained dead and living children that were “skin and bones, just a horrifying sight.” In the third 
          barrack, he saw carcasses, with dead humans stacked one after another, seemingly going on forever. In that barrack, he saw irons that were used to burn individuals, 
          their skulls inverted. Fifty years after these events, while discussing them, Dean is still moved to tears. After the war, Dean Lettington served on the WW2 Freedom 
          Memorial in the Iowa capitol building. In 2013, Dean Lettington passed away. </h5>

        <h3>Manuel Soodhalter</h3>
        <h5>Manuel Soodhalter served in the US military in WW2. He liberated camps, was part of intelligence operations, and fought directly in several battles. 
          Manuel was born in 1916 and was a teenager during the Great Depression. His most notable intelligence mission is known as “Operation Overlord.” This operation was a 
          full-scale invasion of France, specifically Omaha beach. Manuel, along with two other officers, planned out the trenches, where guns would be stationed, where 
          soldiers would be, where American tanks would come in, and what landmines were to be used. This strategic planning is how the allies won this battle. Later it was 
          named D-Day. This successful invasion of German-occupied France allowed the allies to push further into France, and ultimately allied soldiers were inside Germany. 
          The day was June 6th, 1944, and it marked a turning point in the war. Less than a year later, after the allied occupation of Western German territory, a Jewish 
          synagogue reopened on March 24th, 1945, in Concord, Germany. Germany surrendered on May 7th, 1945. Manuel also took part in the liberation of the second largest 
          concentration camp, Buchenwald. This camp was liberated on April 11th, 1945. Here he saw the worst horrors of WW2. In a Nazi officials room, lamps and other objects 
          were found to be made out of human skin. A room next door contained fresh corpses of individuals who had been skinned. Upon returning to Iowa after the war, he 
          opened a successful restaurant in the Quad Cities called Dad’s Drive-in. </h5>
